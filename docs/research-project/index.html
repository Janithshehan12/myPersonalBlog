However, I wasn't able to start any projects because I didn’t have an idea of how to start a research project.</p><p>I first got inspired to do research when I got a chance to participate in the webinar "How to Conduct Academic Research" which was organized by the Department of Marine Engineering,  Ocean University of Sri Lanka and conducted by Dr. Nirman Jayarathna and Dr. Apsara Abeysiriwardena. It was an amazing webinar. The most important guidelines I got from that webinar was how to structure a research paper and how to read a research paper.  This was my first spark to do research.</p><p>With that spark, I tried to find more information about research methodology. I found a YouTube channel called “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IQLabs">IQ LABS </a>'' which was a very informative YouTube channel for Undergraduates. From that channel, there were several types of videos for beginners to do research: how to read research papers, how to put references using Mendeley, etc. Also, I found Kithmin Wickramasinghe's personal <a href="https://blog.kithmin.xyz/">blog</a> using that channel. This was an extremely important resource which made a huge impact in my journey to do research.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Mp62kGijHkJHijth_hEYUdsytOQOSp2VDUVaBFWl5XEK2_6mK7NrnXezzu1Gx-nM52WtSr9uHdL5lHMI5c32jteOAazGf_HVkXnwMWZATM8rJ4u3QFSgTRYE_vg_pL47QQQaJRo" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Although these resources gave me a small idea to do research, I was still afraid to do research. I thought about what I can do and I contacted lecturers but still, I wasn't able to start off a project. However, this became the turning point of my life. I mentioned before that I found Kithmin’s Blog and I read some articles. From it, I saw an article about ScholarX. Also, I saw SEF on Facebook. It had a link to apply as a mentee. The name of the program was SCHOLAX’21. Although I didn't know anything about ScholarX and SEF prior to applying,  after applying I found the SEF website and Blog post written by past mentees. Just as those blogs were great resources to me, I guess the blog posts I write now will also be an inspiration and resource to future ScholarX mentees.</p><p>After Applying, as I said in my <a href="https://blog.janith.xyz/scholarx-2021/">first blog</a>, my mentor Hasini sent me the first email asking about my background and research interest. I specifically mentioned my interest to do research projects when I responded to her email. She also appreciated the fact and we talked about it at our first meeting and designed an action plan to make it work.</p><p>Since the first meeting we have had a lot of recurring meetings, twice each month. And as we discussed the first meeting, we focused the first half of each meeting to discuss a specific research project and in the second half we discussed several generic topics related to research such as writing CVs, how to build an Individual Development Plan (IDP), how to write letters to fellow researchers etc. <br></p><p>After our first meeting, Hasini sent me a lot of materials and informational examples on how to pick a research topic and how to create research questions and hypotheses. Following those materials, I managed to formulate a solid research question and hypotheses based on ideas I already was interested in research about.</p><h2 id="my-research-process"><strong>My research process</strong></h2><p>The generic research topic we discussed in the second meeting was the Research process. We discussed the following points;</p><ul><li>How to find a research topic via identifying a common problem.</li><li>How to do an initial literature review</li><li>How to generate research questions and hypotheses.</li><li>Formulating foundational questions to do an in-depth literature review</li><li>Data Collection and Analysis</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2021/08/18131.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1247" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2021/08/18131.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/18131.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/18131.jpg 1600w, ../content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/18131.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="finding-a-research-topic-identifying-a-problem-in-the-world"><strong>Finding a research topic/ identifying a problem in the world</strong></h3><p>As I learned, if we are going to do a research project we must first identify an existing problem in the world. As there are many problems to be resolved in the world, we should first focus on a field of study. Before identifying a field, we must know which field we are interested in. If we work in a field we are not interested in, we won’t have the motivation to complete the research project through all the obstacles we may face on the way. Similarly, if we want to improve our skill sets in a specific field, we can pick that specific field to do the research project in.</p><p>Once we find a field which we like to research in, we identify a problem that we are going to solve and specify a research question based on this problem. For that we have to do an initial literature review to understand the base field.</p><h3 id="how-to-do-an-initial-literature-review"><strong>How to do an initial literature review</strong></h3><p>Firstly, we have to find research articles, blog posts, journals in relevant topics. Mainly we do literature reviews to know what other people have done and how we can improve based on them. From these papers, blogs, journals we have to choose a subset of content related to our research topic.</p><p>I used some tools for my literature review,</p><ul><li><em><strong>Google Scholar</strong></em> - Google scholar is a search engine that is used to find research papers. Using keywords we can find research papers for literature review.  <br></li><li><em><strong>Mendeley</strong></em> - Mendeley is reference manager. We can store research papers as pdfs in Mendeley and can access papers from various devices. it can also be linked with Microsoft Word so that we can add citations easily to our writeups.   <br></li></ul><p>We have to remember all the facts in our literature review when writing up about our research topic once the project is complete and we disseminate the information via research papers. Therefore, we have to take notes in our own words about papers that we read from the very beginning. We can generate a short summary of papers including some background about each paper, methods they used, finding, and results.</p><p><em><strong>Obsidian</strong></em> is a software to collect papers as lists and mind maps as well as take notes as mentioned above. I learned about it from my mentor Hasini. We did a mentoring session “How to do a literature  review”. She introduced Obsidian software in that meeting.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2021/08/Capture-3.JPG" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2021/08/Capture-3.JPG 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/Capture-3.JPG 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/Capture-3.JPG 1600w, ../content/images/2021/08/Capture-3.JPG 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Research Rabbit website&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>Research Rabbit</strong></em> is an online software where we can add papers into different folders. If we select one paper we can see all the references and all the citations of the paper. From this, we can know what people did earlier than that and what people did later. This software was also introduced by my mentor.<br></p><p>Now we have all the software tools required to do literature  reviews. Using Research Rabbit, we can find what researchers did before and later. Then we can download citations using Google Scholar and can add it to citation software like Mendeley.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2021/08/Capture-1.JPG" width="203" height="87" loading="lazy" alt></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2021/08/Capture-2.JPG" width="273" height="140" loading="lazy" alt></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2021/08/Capture.JPG" width="796" height="609" loading="lazy" alt srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2021/08/Capture.JPG 600w, ../content/images/2021/08/Capture.JPG 796w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2021/08/Mendeley_Logo_Vertical.png" width="2000" height="2000" loading="lazy" alt srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2021/08/Mendeley_Logo_Vertical.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/Mendeley_Logo_Vertical.png 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/Mendeley_Logo_Vertical.png 1600w, ../content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/Mendeley_Logo_Vertical.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h3 id="generating-research-questions-and-hypotheses"><strong>Generating research questions and hypotheses</strong></h3><p>A research question defines the specific problem that we are going to solve. After doing a literature review we can identify the gap in the research topic and we can think what we should do in our specific research project.</p><p>Hypotheses are statements of outcomes of the project that we are expecting to obtain based on theoretical background and what other researchers have found in the past.</p><h3 id="formulating-foundational-questions-to-do-an-in-depth-literature-review"><strong>Formulating foundational questions to do an in-depth literature review</strong></h3><p>Defining several \foundational questions helps us to do a detailed literature review on the topic once we have defined a specific research question. Some important foundational questions are as follows;</p><ul><li>What is the problem in the world we are trying to solve?</li><li>Why is this problem important?</li><li>How are we going to solve this problem?</li><li>What is the good that is coming to the word from the outcome that we achieve?</li></ul><h3 id="formulate-research-method"><strong>Formulate Research method</strong></h3><p>After doing literature review, we need to formulate a method for a research project based on the research question and hypothesis. It can be chosen as a Quantitative, Qualitative or Mix method. It will depend on the type of data you need to do a research project.</p><h3 id="data-collection-and-analysis"><strong>Data Collection and Analysis</strong></h3><p>First, we need to specify the measurements and parameters we are going to collect. This is what we do under research methods. We can use what other researchers used for specific measurements.<br></p><p>Once we figure out the research methods, we have to collect and analyze data to conduct research. Therefore, firstly we have to choose a data collection method.</p><p>At this point I had a problem collecting real time data with Covid-19 pandemic. If it wasn’t for this situation, I could have collected real time data. With the pandemic problem I had to request for a previously collected data set for analysis. Currently I am in the process of finding the exact data set that would be suitable for my project.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2021/08/ux-indonesia-pqzRfBhd9r0-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2021/08/ux-indonesia-pqzRfBhd9r0-unsplash.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/ux-indonesia-pqzRfBhd9r0-unsplash.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/ux-indonesia-pqzRfBhd9r0-unsplash.jpg 1600w, ../content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/ux-indonesia-pqzRfBhd9r0-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="how-to-write-an-abstract"><strong>How to write an abstract</strong></h2><p>Once the project is complete, we have to disseminate our findings to the general public and the research audience via a research paper, poster, or presentation. Although I am still working on the main project I am interested in with my mentor, I created an extended abstract for another ongoing project under the guidance of  Hasini after analyzing the data. Author guidelines given for creating an abstract may differ based on the conference you are hoping to submit abstracts. But the structure is mostly as follows:</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em> - It is necessary to write a short summary of literature review and background of research.</p><p><em><strong>Purpose</strong></em> - We need to talk about the gap we identified in the literature review. We also need to write about the question of what we are going to solve.</p><p><em><strong>Methods</strong></em> - In this section we need to explain the procedure we did in our research.</p><p><em><strong>Result &amp; Discussion</strong></em> - we have to discuss findings or what we hope to find in this section. It depends on the stage of the research. In this section we have to explain a little bit more than other sections because this part is mainly focused on the research. As Hasini said, if we put a table or graph to describe results it is valuable for the abstract.</p><p> <em><strong>Conclusion </strong></em>- Finally we need to comment about the importance of our research.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically, we have to sort and summarize all the findings.<br></p><p>This is a summary of the procedure that I followed for my research. I was introduced to many tools and new technologies throughout the research process.  Finally, I want to thank Hasini Weerathunge. my mentor of ScholarX, who guided me to carry out this study and who helped me since the beginning.</p><h3 id="important-links">Important Links</h3><ol><li>Mendeley -<a href="https://www.mendeley.com/"> https://www.mendeley.com/</a></li><li>Research Rabbit -<a href="https://researchrabbitapp.com/"> https://researchrabbitapp.com/</a></li><li>Obsidian -<a href="https://obsidian.md/"> https://obsidian.md/</a></li><li>Google Scholar -<a href="https://scholar.google.com/"> https://scholar.google.com/</a></li><li>IQ Labs YouTube channel  -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IQLabs"> https://www.youtube.com/c/IQLabs</a></li><li>The Rational Optimist -<a href="https://blog.kithmin.xyz/"> https://blog.kithmin.xyz/</a></li></ol><h3 id="images">Images</h3><ol><li>Pixabay -<a href="https://pixabay.com/">https://pixabay.com/</a></li><li>Unsplash -<a href="https://unsplash.com/"> https://unsplash.com/</a></li><li>Freepic - <a href="https://www.freepik.com/">https://www.freepik.com/</a><br></li></ol><p><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p><br><br></p>
