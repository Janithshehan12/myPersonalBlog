However, I wasn&apos;t able to start any projects because I didn&#x2019;t have an idea of how to start a research project.</p><p>I first got inspired to do research when I got a chance to participate in the webinar &quot;How to Conduct Academic Research&quot; which was organized by the Department of Marine Engineering, &#xA0;Ocean University of Sri Lanka and conducted by Dr. Nirman Jayarathna and Dr. Apsara Abeysiriwardena. It was an amazing webinar. The most important guidelines I got from that webinar was how to structure a research paper and how to read a research paper. &#xA0;This was my first spark to do research.</p><p>With that spark, I tried to find more information about research methodology. I found a YouTube channel called &#x201C; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IQLabs">IQ LABS </a>&apos;&apos; which was a very informative YouTube channel for Undergraduates. From that channel, there were several types of videos for beginners to do research: how to read research papers, how to put references using Mendeley, etc. Also, I found Kithmin Wickramasinghe&apos;s personal <a href="https://blog.kithmin.xyz/">blog</a> using that channel. This was an extremely important resource which made a huge impact in my journey to do research.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Mp62kGijHkJHijth_hEYUdsytOQOSp2VDUVaBFWl5XEK2_6mK7NrnXezzu1Gx-nM52WtSr9uHdL5lHMI5c32jteOAazGf_HVkXnwMWZATM8rJ4u3QFSgTRYE_vg_pL47QQQaJRo" class="kg-image" alt="How to start a research project from scratch" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Although these resources gave me a small idea to do research, I was still afraid to do research. I thought about what I can do and I contacted lecturers but still, I wasn&apos;t able to start off a project. However, this became the turning point of my life. I mentioned before that I found Kithmin&#x2019;s Blog and I read some articles. From it, I saw an article about ScholarX. Also, I saw SEF on Facebook. It had a link to apply as a mentee. The name of the program was SCHOLAX&#x2019;21. Although I didn&apos;t know anything about ScholarX and SEF prior to applying, &#xA0;after applying I found the SEF website and Blog post written by past mentees. Just as those blogs were great resources to me, I guess the blog posts I write now will also be an inspiration and resource to future ScholarX mentees.</p><p>After Applying, as I said in my <a href="https://blog.janith.xyz/scholarx-2021/">first blog</a>, my mentor Hasini sent me the first email asking about my background and research interest. I specifically mentioned my interest to do research projects when I responded to her email. She also appreciated the fact and we talked about it at our first meeting and designed an action plan to make it work.</p><p>Since the first meeting we have had a lot of recurring meetings, twice each month. And as we discussed the first meeting, we focused the first half of each meeting to discuss a specific research project and in the second half we discussed several generic topics related to research such as writing CVs, how to build an Individual Development Plan (IDP), how to write letters to fellow researchers etc. <br></p><p>After our first meeting, Hasini sent me a lot of materials and informational examples on how to pick a research topic and how to create research questions and hypotheses. Following those materials, I managed to formulate a solid research question and hypotheses based on ideas I already was interested in research about.</p><h2 id="my-research-process"><strong>My research process</strong></h2><p>The generic research topic we discussed in the second meeting was the Research process. We discussed the following points;</p><ul><li>How to find a research topic via identifying a common problem.</li><li>How to do an initial literature review</li><li>How to generate research questions and hypotheses.</li><li>Formulating foundational questions to do an in-depth literature review</li><li>Data Collection and Analysis</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/18131.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How to start a research project from scratch" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1247" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/18131.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/18131.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/18131.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/18131.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="finding-a-research-topic-identifying-a-problem-in-the-world"><strong>Finding a research topic/ identifying a problem in the world</strong></h3><p>As I learned, if we are going to do a research project we must first identify an existing problem in the world. As there are many problems to be resolved in the world, we should first focus on a field of study. Before identifying a field, we must know which field we are interested in. If we work in a field we are not interested in, we won&#x2019;t have the motivation to complete the research project through all the obstacles we may face on the way. Similarly, if we want to improve our skill sets in a specific field, we can pick that specific field to do the research project in.</p><p>Once we find a field which we like to research in, we identify a problem that we are going to solve and specify a research question based on this problem. For that we have to do an initial literature review to understand the base field.</p><h3 id="how-to-do-an-initial-literature-review"><strong>How to do an initial literature review</strong></h3><p>Firstly, we have to find research articles, blog posts, journals in relevant topics. Mainly we do literature reviews to know what other people have done and how we can improve based on them. From these papers, blogs, journals we have to choose a subset of content related to our research topic.</p><p>I used some tools for my literature review,</p><ul><li><em><strong>Google Scholar</strong></em> - Google scholar is a search engine that is used to find research papers. Using keywords we can find research papers for literature review. &#xA0;<br></li><li><em><strong>Mendeley</strong></em> - Mendeley is reference manager. We can store research papers as pdfs in Mendeley and can access papers from various devices. it can also be linked with Microsoft Word so that we can add citations easily to our writeups. &#xA0; <br></li></ul><p>We have to remember all the facts in our literature review when writing up about our research topic once the project is complete and we disseminate the information via research papers. Therefore, we have to take notes in our own words about papers that we read from the very beginning. We can generate a short summary of papers including some background about each paper, methods they used, finding, and results.</p><p><em><strong>Obsidian</strong></em> is a software to collect papers as lists and mind maps as well as take notes as mentioned above. I learned about it from my mentor Hasini. We did a mentoring session &#x201C;How to do a literature &#xA0;review&#x201D;. She introduced Obsidian software in that meeting.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/Capture-3.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="How to start a research project from scratch" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/Capture-3.JPG 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/Capture-3.JPG 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/Capture-3.JPG 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/Capture-3.JPG 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Research Rabbit website&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>Research Rabbit</strong></em> is an online software where we can add papers into different folders. If we select one paper we can see all the references and all the citations of the paper. From this, we can know what people did earlier than that and what people did later. This software was also introduced by my mentor.<br></p><p>Now we have all the software tools required to do literature &#xA0;reviews. Using Research Rabbit, we can find what researchers did before and later. Then we can download citations using Google Scholar and can add it to citation software like Mendeley.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/Capture-1.JPG" width="203" height="87" loading="lazy" alt="How to start a research project from scratch"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/Capture-2.JPG" width="273" height="140" loading="lazy" alt="How to start a research project from scratch"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/Capture.JPG" width="796" height="609" loading="lazy" alt="How to start a research project from scratch" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/Capture.JPG 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/Capture.JPG 796w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/Mendeley_Logo_Vertical.png" width="2000" height="2000" loading="lazy" alt="How to start a research project from scratch" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/Mendeley_Logo_Vertical.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/Mendeley_Logo_Vertical.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/Mendeley_Logo_Vertical.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/Mendeley_Logo_Vertical.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h3 id="generating-research-questions-and-hypotheses"><strong>Generating research questions and hypotheses</strong></h3><p>A research question defines the specific problem that we are going to solve.

Some important foundational questions are as follows;</p><ul><li>What is the problem in the world we are trying to solve?</li><li>Why is this problem important?</li><li>How are we going to solve this problem?</li><li>What is the good that is coming to the word from the outcome that we achieve?</li></ul><h3 id="formulate-research-method"><strong>Formulate Research method</strong></h3><p>After doing literature review, we need to formulate a method for a research project based on the research question and hypothesis. It can be chosen as a Quantitative, Qualitative or Mix method. It will depend on the type of data you need to do a research project.</p><h3 id="data-collection-and-analysis"><strong>Data Collection and Analysis</strong></h3><p>First, we need to specify the measurements and parameters we are going to collect. This is what we do under research methods. We can use what other researchers used for specific measurements.<br></p><p>Once we figure out the research methods, we have to collect and analyze data to conduct research. Therefore, firstly we have to choose a data collection method.</p><p>At this point I had a problem collecting real time data with Covid-19 pandemic. If it wasn&#x2019;t for this situation, I could have collected real time data. With the pandemic problem I had to request for a previously collected data set for analysis. Currently I am in the process of finding the exact data set that would be suitable for my project.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/08/ux-indonesia-pqzRfBhd9r0-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How to start a research project from scratch" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/ux-indonesia-pqzRfBhd9r0-unsplash.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/ux-indonesia-pqzRfBhd9r0-unsplash.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/ux-indonesia-pqzRfBhd9r0-unsplash.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/ux-indonesia-pqzRfBhd9r0-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="how-to-write-an-abstract"><strong>How to write an abstract</strong></h2><p>Once the project is complete, we have to disseminate our findings to the general public and the research audience via a research paper, poster, or presentation. Although I am still working on the main project I am interested in with my mentor, I created an extended abstract for another ongoing project under the guidance of &#xA0;Hasini after analyzing the data. Author guidelines given for creating an abstract may differ based on the conference you are hoping to submit abstracts. But the structure is mostly as follows:</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em> - It is necessary to write a short summary of literature review and background of research.</p><p><em><strong>Purpose</strong></em> - We need to talk about the gap we identified in the literature review. We also need to write about the question of what we are going to solve.</p><p><em><strong>Methods</strong></em> - In this section we need to explain the procedure we did in our research.</p><p><em><strong>Result &amp; Discussion</strong></em> - we have to discuss findings or what we hope to find in this section. It depends on the stage of the research. In this section we have to explain a little bit more than other sections because this part is mainly focused on the research. As Hasini said, if we put a table or graph to describe results it is valuable for the abstract.</p><p> <em><strong>Conclusion </strong></em>- Finally we need to comment about the importance of our research.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically, we have to sort and summarize all the findings.<br></p><p>This is a summary of the procedure that I followed for my research. I was introduced to many tools and new technologies throughout the research process. &#xA0;Finally, I want to thank Hasini Weerathunge. my mentor of ScholarX, who guided me to carry out this study and who helped me since the beginning.</p><h3 id="important-links">Important Links</h3><ol><li>Mendeley -<a href="https://www.mendeley.com/"> https://www.mendeley.com/</a></li><li>Research Rabbit -<a href="https://researchrabbitapp.com/"> https://researchrabbitapp.com/</a></li><li>Obsidian -<a href="https://obsidian.md/"> https://obsidian.md/</a></li><li>Google Scholar -<a href="https://scholar.google.com/"> https://scholar.google.com/</a></li><li>IQ Labs YouTube channel &#xA0;-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IQLabs"> https://www.youtube.com/c/IQLabs</a></li><li>The Rational Optimist -<a href="https://blog.kithmin.xyz/"> https://blog.kithmin.xyz/</a></li></ol><h3 id="images">Images</h3><ol><li>Pixabay -<a href="https://pixabay.com/">https://pixabay.com/</a></li><li>Unsplash -<a href="https://unsplash.com/"> https://unsplash.com/</a></li><li>Freepic - <a href="https://www.freepik.com/">https://www.freepik.com/</a><br></li></ol><p><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[INTRODUCTION AND MY EXPERIENCE OF SCHOLARX 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA["ScholarX is a 6-month program for Sri-Lankan undergraduates who would like to get free premium mentoring during their study period."]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/scholarx-2021/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">609bec8257fa5400642fb250</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Janith Shehan Rathnayaka]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 22 May 2021 14:50:05 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/06/image-1-1.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="INTRODUCTION AND MY EXPERIENCE OF SCHOLARX 2021" loading="lazy" width="922" height="448" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/image-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/image-1.png 922w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><hr><h2 id="what-is-scholarx"><strong>What is ScholarX?</strong></h2><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/06/image-1-1.png" alt="INTRODUCTION AND MY EXPERIENCE OF SCHOLARX 2021"><p><strong>&quot;</strong><em><strong>ScholarX is a 6-month program for Sri-Lankan undergraduates who would like to get free premium mentoring during their study period.</strong></em><strong>&quot; </strong>ScholarX is founded by the Sustainable Education Foundation which creates great opportunities for undergraduates who are looking to develop their soft skills with the guidance of professionals.</p><h3 id="connecting-with-my-mentor">Connecting with my mentor</h3><p>After applying for this program I got the first email from SEF and they had been able to match me with a mentor. My mentor was Hasini Weerathunge, and her LinkedIn profile was attached to the email to provide me more information about her areas of study and research interests. They introduced the guidelines which we have to follow throughout the 6 month time period clearly. At the end they said to fill the Student Agreement Form to secure membership.</p><p>My mentor contacted me on 03rd May 2021, ahead of the program kickoff date (15th May 2021). In the first email, She included a brief Introduction about the current situation in studying and her research interests. She described the mentoring structure at the end.</p><h3 id="about-my-mentor">About my mentor</h3><p>As mentioned above, my mentor is <em><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasiniw/">Hasini Rathsara Weerathunge.</a> </strong></em>She is a PhD candidate in the Biomedical Engineering Program of Boston University. She has expertise in biomedical engineering, signal processing, and academic research. She had obtained her Bachelor&apos;s degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa and worked in the industry as a research engineer for several years prior to joining graduate school at Boston University.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="INTRODUCTION AND MY EXPERIENCE OF SCHOLARX 2021" loading="lazy" width="978" height="432" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/image.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/image.png 978w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="first-meeting">First Meeting</h3><p>I sent my first email as a reply to my mentor&apos;s email mentioning my education level and my background. Then my mentor scheduled the first meeting to be on 15 th of May 2021.</p><p>After fixing the day of the meeting I received another email from my mentor asking about my expectations throughout the program.</p><p>At the first meeting, We met using the Zoom app, and first Hasini introduced herself, talking about her background, research, and experiences in transitioning to graduate school from industry. Then I introduced myself. She asked about my future plans for the next five years. We discussed and decided to build my long term and short term career plans using the individual development plan (IDP) format. My first step was to create and IDP for the next 6 months.</p><p>To develop my research skills, We decided to do a research project within these six months. Finally, We planned to have 12 meetings in total with each meeting having an initial 30 minutes for generic topics and the last 30 minutes for the dedicated research project that we planned to work on together.</p><p>As Hasini told me in the first session, I got a follow up email from her with instructions to build my IDP, set specific goals, and select a research topic.</p><p>That email contained instructions and following attachments,</p><p>1. Attachment of IDP tutorial</p><p>2. How to set Specific Goals</p><p>3. Template for creating IDP</p><p>4. Instructions to create a research topic</p><p>While the above points summarise the email, a lot of instructions and materials were also included in that email. She also mentioned to feel free to email to clarify any problems and ask any questions. It was clear that she wanted to try to help and guide me and thus, I was determined to make the best of the opportunity and be an effective mentee with her guidance.</p><p>Following my mentor&apos;s instructions, I started to work on my IDP, specific goals, and selecting an interesting research topic. Our mentors are volunteers, allocating their valuable time amidst their busy schedules. Therefore, I didn&apos;t want to waste my mentoring time and worked hard to be ready with the assigned tasks for the next meeting.</p><h3 id="second-meeting">Second Meeting</h3><p>We had our second meeting on 05th of June and we discussed work-life balance and working hard vs. working smart. It was a very interesting topic. Before that discussion, I had no idea how to work without stress. Thus far, I had done my work without a proper plan.</p><p>Hasini told me to note down the important points that were discussed within the meeting. Taking notes was an important habit to cultivate as a mentee and she mentioned as a mentee, she also found it to be very useful when working with her research mentor. This was very relevant to me practically, as I had to follow up with her via email because I forgot an important point she mentioned in our prior meeting. In this meeting, we also talked about solidifying the research goal and research questions of the research project.</p><p>Thus far, the SochlarX program has been very fruitful to me. It has improved my motivation to work towards my goals and focused me to attain specific aims. I hope to follow up in future to share my experience with the ScholarX program in my next post. Keep in touch !</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>-Janith Shehan -</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
