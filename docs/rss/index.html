My mentor was Hasini Weerathunge, and her LinkedIn profile was attached to the email to provide me more information about her areas of study and research interests. They introduced the guidelines which we have to follow throughout the 6 month time period clearly. At the end they said to fill the Student Agreement Form to secure membership.</p><p>My mentor contacted me on 03rd May 2021, ahead of the program kickoff date (15th May 2021). In the first email, She included a brief Introduction about the current situation in studying and her research interests. She described the mentoring structure at the end.</p><p><strong>About my mentor</strong></p><p>As mentioned above, my mentor is <em><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasiniw/">Hasini Rathsara Weerathunge.</a> </strong></em>She is a PhD candidate in the Biomedical Engineering Program of Boston University. She has expertise in biomedical engineering, signal processing, and academic research. She had obtained her Bachelor&apos;s degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa and worked in the industry as a research engineer for several years prior to joining graduate school at Boston University.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="INTRODUCTION TO SCHOLARX 2021" loading="lazy" width="978" height="432" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/image.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/image.png 978w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>First Meeting,</strong></p><p>I sent my first email as a reply to my mentor&apos;s email mentioning my education level and my background. Then my mentor scheduled the first meeting to be on 15 th of May 2021.</p><p>After fixing the day of the meeting I received another email from my mentor asking about my expectations throughout the program.</p><p>At the first meeting, We met using the Zoom app, and first Hasini introduced herself, talking about her background, research, and experiences in transitioning to graduate school from industry. Then I introduced myself. She asked about my future plans for the next five years. We discussed and decided to build my long term and short term career plans using the individual development plan (IDP) format. My first step was to create and IDP for the next 6 months.</p><p>To develop my research skills, We decided to do a research project within these six months. Finally, We planned to have 12 meetings in total with each meeting having an initial 30 minutes for generic topics and the last 30 minutes for the dedicated research project that we planned to work on together.</p><p>As Hasini told me in the first session, I got a follow up email from her with instructions to build my IDP, set specific goals, and select a research topic.</p><p>That email contained instructions and following attachments,</p><p>1. Attachment of IDP tutorial</p><p>2. How to set Specific Goals</p><p>3. Template for creating IDP</p><p>4. Instructions to create a research topic</p><p>While the above points summarise the email, a lot of instructions and materials were also included in that email. She also mentioned to feel free to email to clarify any problems and ask any questions. It was clear that she wanted to try to help and guide me and thus, I was determined to make the best of the opportunity and be an effective mentee with her guidance.</p><p>Following my mentor&apos;s instructions, I started to work on my IDP, specific goals, and selecting an interesting research topic. Our mentors are volunteers, allocating their valuable time amidst their busy schedules. Therefore, I didn&apos;t want to waste my mentoring time and worked hard to be ready with the assigned tasks for the next meeting.</p><p><strong>Second Meeting</strong></p><p>We had our second meeting on 05th of June and we discussed work-life balance and working hard vs. working smart. It was a very interesting topic. Before that discussion, I had no idea how to work without stress. Thus far, I had done my work without a proper plan.</p><p>Hasini told me to note down the important points that were discussed within the meeting. Taking notes was an important habit to cultivate as a mentee and she mentioned as a mentee, she also found it to be very useful when working with her research mentor. This was very relevant to me practically, as I had to follow up with her via email because I forgot an important point she mentioned in our prior meeting. In this meeting, we also talked about solidifying the research goal and research questions of the research project.</p><p>Thus far, the SochlarX program has been very fruitful to me. It has improved my motivation to work towards my goals and focused me to attain specific aims. I hope to follow up in future to share my experience with the ScholarX program in my next post. Keep in touch !</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>-Janith Shehan -</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
