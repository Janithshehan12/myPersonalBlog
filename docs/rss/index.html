They introduced the guidelines which we have to follow through out the 6 month time period clearly. At the end they said to fill the Student Agreement Form for secure membership.</p><p>Then, I have found my mentor Hasini Weerathunge&apos;s Linkdin profile from the email which &#xA0;was mentioned earlier . It was easy to find more details about her. I went through that Linkedin profile to find her studying areas and interested areas. &#xA0;I waited for her email and I got it in Monday, 03 May 2021. </p><p>In the first email, She included brief Introduction about current situation in studying and her research interests. She described the mentoring structure at the end.</p><h2 id="about-my-mentor">About my mentor</h2><p> As mentioned above, my mentor is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasiniw/"><em><strong>Hasini Rathsara Weerathunge</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>She is a PhD candidate in the Biomedical Engineering Program of Boston University. &#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="INTRODUCTION TO SCHOLARX 2021" loading="lazy" width="978" height="432" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/image.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/05/image.png 978w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="first-meeting">First Meeting,</h2><p>I sent my first email as a reply for my mentor&apos;s email with mentioning about my education level and my background. Then Mrs. Hasini Scheduled the first meeting on 15 th of May 2021. &#xA0; </p><p>After fixing the day of meeting &#xA0;I have received an another email which was asking about my expectations through out the program &#xA0;from Mrs. Hasini prior to the meeting. </p><p>At first meeting, We met using Zoom app and firstly Mrs. Hasini introduced her self and asked about me. Then I also introduced my self too. &#xA0;Mrs. Hasini asked my future plans for next five years. we discussed about it. We decided to rebuild future plan and make a plan for next 6 months. &#xA0;So our first step was to create a plane for next 6 months.</p><p>Firstly she gave me a task to do before next meeting. It was to build my IDP (Individual development plan). For developing my research skills, We decided to do small research within this six months. Finally we discussed to arrange two meetings per month and then our first meeting was ended.</p><p>As Mrs. Hasini told me in the first session, I got the next email with instructions to build my IDP and create research topic. </p><p>That email contained instructions and following attachments,</p><ol><li>Attachment of IDP tutorial</li><li>How to set Specific Goals</li><li>Template for creating IDP </li><li>Instructions to create research topic</li></ol><p>This is a summery of that email. Lot of instructions and materials have included in that email.</p><p>Following Mrs. Hasini&apos;s instructions, I started to work on given task.</p><p>Keep in touch with me.
