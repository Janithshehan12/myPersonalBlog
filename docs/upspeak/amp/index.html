This is a free 12 week program aimed at creating a non-competitive safe environment for undergraduates in Sri Lanka whose second language is English and are looking to develop the following skills as published by Cambridge Papers in ELT:</em><br /></p><ul><li><em><em><em>Develop their conversational competence,</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>Become more proficient in the use of appropriate, rather than just accurate language,</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>Learn to play with language and take risks with it,</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>Building positive group dynamics for learning”</em></em></em></li></ul><p>I did my studies in Sinhala language while schooling. I didn't care about the English language because I thought it was only one of my subjects. </p><p>After entering university, I realized the importance of the English language. I had to study all the subjects in the English language. All exams, assignments, reports, and quizzes all are in the English language. I wanted to change. I had to work to develop my English knowledge. With work I was able to develop my English knowledge little by little. But I am afraid to speak with others. I faced a lot of difficulties contacting lecturers because of language problems.</p><p>I have studied English for 13 years since my primary education but the problem is why I can't speak. And when I was in my first year in University I had to do a presentation for my subject. But I wasn't able to do it better. It was not about my subject knowledge, it was about language matters. </p><p>I faced a communication problem in the first meeting of ScholarX and I really wanted to improve my communication skills. I tried to do it individually but it was very hard to do. I saw a post about Upspeak on the Facebook page of SEF. Also, Hasini, who is my mentor at ScholarX, suggested to me the Upspeak program develop my communication skills. </p><p>I found a link to apply to the UpSpeak program and I shared it with my friends before I applied. I had to submit a small video with an application. After applying, I got the first email from SEF including a small introduction video. That email said they selected me for the Upspeak program and they introduced the program facilitator, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/minuri/">Minuri Adasuriya</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><amp-img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/akYsNX3U9tsB1J4FwYfHtACAwo_ezTP_hbShF0dVDRHtR-Y9HBjuHM1uB5rxodPwQYUrSYrbHMwCft65AZ_pSGf1gfGtjsuUHCEseQbP9ViFZwdWlUiOLu5kQDuVrR2PJAc5-N1Y=s0" class="kg-image" alt width="981" height="479" layout="responsive"></amp-img></figure><p>Minuri is an one of advisors of the Sustainable Education Foundation. Also experienced HR professional with 14+ years of working in Generalist, Shared Services and Talent portfolios delivering global level projects in complex multinational organizations’, with stakeholders across multiple geographical regions. HR Futurist at heart. Passionate about creating inclusive work cultures, embedding HR technology, knowledge sharing and business process improvement. And Currently working as the Head of Programs &amp; Community Success at Hatch</p><p>We had several meetings within the last months, one meeting per week. In the beginning of the series, I hadn't any idea how to communicate with the group and how this program would go on. The UpSpeak team had selected eight members who are undergraduate students for this program.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><amp-img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Un578k0DQbKfqzvAraCBj3W0ZdF2c1yFdufudHrn7S0UGHrYYV73-D7Azap32LYRMhS_qyd8m5JztuuUrq0B2T2g5KFqlHUWKvcRU9q2pI-la6YX5sy0tvoJoUQv-ZgS-AWUbsLu=s0" class="kg-image" alt width="1508" height="866" layout="responsive"></amp-img></figure><p>On the very first day, Minuri introduced herself and she asked about us.  And she asked us to turn on our cameras,  we turned on our cameras but we turned it on only when talking after talking we turned off our camera. One important thing which I wanted to mention here is now we turn on our cameras when we start the meeting. It was very hard for me to turn on the camera in the beginning. I don't know why, but now I’m comfortable talking in front of the camera because of UpSpeak.</p><p>We had meetings on Sunday morning. Minuri gave us tasks in every meeting. The first task was to talk for 5 minutes about the “ Chemical fertilizers ban of Sri Lanka”. It’s my first time doing a speech in English. But It wasn’t hard because all the time Minuri helped with our weak points. My main problem was forgetting words. I waited a few seconds to find a word and finish the sentence but Minuri and my batch friends listened carefully about what I said.  </p><p>Also, we had an individual meeting with Minuri in one week. In that meeting, Minuri asked me some questions and she asked what I wanted to know from her. I asked about Hatch and she explained about Hatch and their works.</p><p>We had two amazing meetings. In the first meeting, Minuri grouped us and we had two members. Our task was to talk with our partner for 5 minutes but she didn't give us a topic. We had to create conversation. The second one also gave a task to talk with a partner and Minuri put another member after 5 minutes. We had to talk with each other and continue the conversation. Those two meetings were really amazing. I couldn’t believe I talked for 5 minutes but didn’t feel it was 5 minutes. </p><p>All the time I saw Minuri put notes when we talked and after that, she corrected wrong pronunciations, grammar points, and all the things that should be improved. One thing I can't forget is that she told us in all the meetings to be careful about the pronunciation of “Have” and “Ve” sounds to us. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"></figure><p>I think I was able to develop my positive thinking, not only communication skills. My opinion is that if we have the passion to do something and love to do that we can do it better. Most important thing was that Minuri didn’t try to teach us. She created a comfortable platform for us to talk and she guided us to reduce our shortcomings.</p><p>Finally, I want to thank SEF &amp; Minuri for giving me this opportunity.</p><hr></hr><p><a href="https://sefglobal.org/upspeak/">https://sefglobal.org/upspeak/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sefglobal/mycompany/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/sefglobal/mycompany/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6845609474691084288/">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6845609474691084288/</a></p>
